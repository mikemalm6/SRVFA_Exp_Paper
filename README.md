Relevant files for the paper: "Validation of Single Reference Variable Flip Angle (SR-VFA) dynamic T1 mapping with T2* correction against the gold standard in an innovative rotating phantom"

## Phantom design files:
The solidworks assembly is provided which has a v6 configuration and a v5 configuration. v5 corresponds with the stationary phantom, and v6 corresponds with the rotating phantom.
Each of the design components also have v5 and v6 configurations. The STL files are just those for the v6 dynamic rotation phantom. 
Details on the MRI-compatible motor assembly are not given here, as those rights belong to the company 4D Surgical.
